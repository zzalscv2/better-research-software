::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Software is [fundamental to modern research][ssi-survey-2014] - some of it would even be impossible without software.
From short, thrown-together temporary scripts written to help with day-to-day research tasks, through an abundance of complex data analysis spreadsheets, to the hundreds of software engineers and millions of lines of code behind international efforts such as the Large Hadron Collider, there are few areas of research where software does not have a fundamental role.

This course teaches good practices and reproducible working methods that are agnostic of a programming language (although we will use Python code in our examples).
It aims to provide researchers with the tools and knowledge to feel confident when writing **good quality and sustainable software** to support their research.
Although the discussion will often focus on software developed in the context of research, most of the good practices introduced here are beneficial to software development more generally.

## Reproducible research

The lesson is particularly focused on one aspect of good (scientific) software development practice: improving software to enhance reproducibility.
That is, enabling others to run our code and obtain the same results we did.

## Why should I care about reproducibility?

Scientific transparency and rigor are key factors in research.
Scientific methodology and results need to be published openly and replicated and confirmed by several independent parties.
However, research papers often lack the full details required for independent reproduction or replication. 
Many attempts at reproducing or replicating the results of scientific studies have failed in a variety of disciplines ranging from psychology ([The Open Science Collaboration (2015)][replication-crisis-osc]) to cancer sciences ([Errington et al (2021)][replication-crisis-errington]).
These are called [**the reproducibility and replicability crises**][reproducibility-crisis] - ongoing methodological crises in which the results of many scientific studies are difficult or impossible to repeat.

Reproducible research is a practice that ensures that researchers can repeat the same analysis multiple times with the same results.
It offers many benefits to those who practice it:

* Reproducible research helps researchers remember how and why they performed specific tasks and analyses; this enables easier explanation of work to collaborators and reviewers.
* Reproducible research enables researchers to quickly modify analyses and figures - this is often required at all stages of research and automating this process saves loads of time.
* Reproducible research enables reusability of previously conducted tasks so that new projects that require the same or similar tasks become much easier and efficient by reusing or reconfiguring previous work.
* Reproducible research supports researchers' career development by facilitating the reuse and citation of all research outputs - including both code and data.
* Reproducible research is a strong indicator of rigor, trustworthiness, and transparency in scientific research.
  This can increase the quality and speed of peer review, because reviewers can directly access the analytical process described in a manuscript.
  It increases the probability that errors are caught early on - by collaborators or during the peer-review process, helping alleviate the reproducibility crisis.  

However, reproducible research often requires that researchers implement new practices and learn new tools.
This course aims to teach some of these practices and tools pertaining to the use of software to conduct reproducible research.

Review [the Reproducible Research Discussion](./reproducible-research-discussion.md) for a more in-depth discussion of this topic.

## Practices for building better research software

The practices we will cover for building better research software fall into three areas.

### 1. Things you can do with your own computing environment to enhance the software

* Using virtual development environments ensures your software can be developed and run consistently across different systems, making it easier for you and others to run, reuse, and extend your code.

### 2. Things you can do to improve the source code of the software itself

* Organising and structuring your code and project directory keeps your software clean, modular, and reusable, enhancing its readability, extensibility, and reusability.
* Following coding conventions for your programming language produces consistently formatted code that others find it easy to read, reuse or extend in their own examples and applications.
* Writing structured documentation strings and comments within your code will make it more understandable to others who wish to use or extend it. 
* Testing can save time spent on debugging and ensures that your code is correct and does what it is set out to do, giving you and others confidence in your code and the results it produces.

### 3. Things you can do to make the software easier for other people to use

* Using version control and collaboration platforms like [GitHub](https://github.com), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com), and [CodeBerg](https://codeberg.org/) makes it easier to share code and work on it together.
* Fostering a community around your software and promoting collaboration helps to grow a user base for your software and contributes to its long-term sustainability.
* Providing clear and comprehensive documentation, including code comments, API specifications, setup guides, and usage instructions, ensures your software is easy to understand, use, and extend (by you and others).
* Accompanying your software with clear information about its licensing terms and how it should be cited ensures that others can reuse and adapt your code with confidence and that you receive credit when they do so.

:::::::::::::::::: challenge

### Tools and practices you use (5 min)

Individually,

- reflect on what practices or tools you are already using in your software development workflow,
- list some new practices or tools that you would like to start employing or using.

Write your reflections in the shared collaborative document.

###  FAIR software

Some of the practices covered here also align with the [FAIR Research Software Principles][fair-principles-research-software] and are explored further in the [additional episode on FAIR software][fair-software-episode]. 
However, FAIR is just one of several frameworks that can guide the development of high-quality research software. 
What matters most is recognising how each of these individual practices—whether or not they come from FAIR—helps you produce software that is more reliable, maintainable, and useful to others.

## Our research software project

You are going to follow a fairly typical experience of a new researcher (e.g. a PhD student or a postdoc) joining a research group.
You were emailed some spacewalks data and analysis code bundled in the `spacewalks.zip` archive, written by another group 
member who worked on similar things but has since left. You need to be able to install and run this code on your 
machine, check you can understand it and then adapt it to your own project.

As part of the [setup for this course](./installation-instructions.html#spacewalks), you may have downloaded or been emailed the `spacewalks.zip` archive. 
If not, you can [download it](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/better-research-software/raw/refs/heads/main/learners/spacewalks.zip) now.
Save the `spacewalks.zip` archive to your home directory and extract it - you should get a directory called `spacewalks`.

### Opening the project

We will use VS Code IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for software development.

IDEs are graphical application that provide a comprehensive workspace for writing, editing, testing, and debugging code - all in one place. 
At the core of an IDE is a code editor, and it combines several tools that developers need into a single interface to streamline the code development process. 
IDEs are extremely useful and modern software development would be very hard without them.
Some of IDEs also provide graphical interface to a version control system which typically contains a subset of all available version control commands.

VS Code integrates many of these tools and functionalities (e.g. file and project exploring, running code in terminal, viewing different file types, running a testing framework or a debugger, version control system, etc.) either natively or via a large number of extensions.
It is a popular choice among many researchers, but it is not the only one.
Outside of this course, you will make a choice which IDE or code editor to use based on your and your team's preferences.

As part of setup, we have installed a few extensions for VS Code to make our software development experience easier.

To open our directory `spacewalks` in VS Code – go to **File -> Open Folder** and find `spacewalks`.

::: callout

Orient the users and navigate around VS Code.

* Explorer - the top one is a file navigator, or explorer - we can use this to open existing folders containing program files.
* Search - the next one down is a search capability, so you can search for things (and replace them with other text) over your code files.
* Source control - this gives you access to source code control, which includes Git version control functionality. This feature means you can do things like clone Git repositories (for example, from GitHub), add and commit files to a repository, things like that.
* Run and Debug - this allows you to run programs you write in a special way with a debugger, which allows you to check the state of your program as it is running, which is very useful and we’ll look into later.
* Extensions - this allows you to install extensions to VS Code to extend its functionality in some way.
* Terminal - allows access to a command line terminal to type various commands (via Terminal -> New Terminal (Windows users need to make sure the new terminal is “GitBash”; not “PowerShell” or “cmd”)).

Check that learners have installed **Microsoft Python extension for Visual Studio Code**. 
This extension provides support for Python language and will also automatically install Microsoft Pylance (IntelliSense, performant Python language support) and Microsoft Python Debugger extensions.

### Inspecting the project

The first thing you may want to do is inspect the content of the code and data you received to learn more about what it does. 

You may notice that the software project contains:

1. A JSON file called `data.json` - a snippet of which is shown below - with data on extra-vehicular activities 
(EVAs, i.e. spacewalks) undertaken by astronauts and cosmonauts from 1965 to 2013 (data provided by NASA via its [Open Data Portal](https://data.nasa.gov/Raw-Data/Extra-vehicular-Activity-EVA-US-and-Russia/9kcy-zwvn/about_data)).

   ![JSON data file snippet showing EVA/spacewalk data including EVA ID, country, crew members, vehicle type, date of the spacewalk, duration, and purpose](fig/astronaut-data-json-single-line-snippet.png){alt='JSON data file snippet showing EVA/spacewalk data including EVA ID, country, crew members, vehicle type, date of the spacewalk, duration, and purpose'}
2. A Python script called `my code v2.py` containing some analysis code.

   ![The first few lines of a Python script](fig/astronaut-analysis-original-code-screenshot.png){alt='The first few lines of a Python script used as example code for the episode'}

   The code in the Python script does some common research tasks:

  * Reads in the data from the JSON file
  * Changes the data from one data format to another and saves to a file in the new format (CSV)
  * Performs some calculations to generate summary statistics about the data
  * Makes a plot to visualise the data

3. A folder called `astronaut-data-analysis-old` - which presumably contains previous versions of the analysis acting as some sort of a backup.
4. A hidden file `.DS_Store` - Desktop Services Store is a hidden metadata file automatically created by macOS Finder in every folder, storing user-specific view settings like icon positions, window size, and background colors, acting much like Windows' `desktop.ini`.
This makes us think that the author was using macOS operating system but this file does not make part of the project itself.

If you do not see hidden file `.DS_Store`, that means that your VS Code is configured to exclude certain files and directories from the File Explorer View.
One way to modify this is going to ‘Code’ > ‘Preferences’ > ‘Settings’ (‘Code’ > ‘Preferences’ > ‘Settings’ on macOS) and searching for ‘exclude’ and you will find the default exclude list under `Files: exclude`.
You can remove the `**/.DS_Store` pattern and the hidden file `.DS_Store` should appear in VS Code's File Explorer.

Alternatively, open a terminal window within VS Code, navigate to your `spacewalks` folder (we are assuming you downloaded it into your home directory) and issue `ls -la` command to list the directory contents.

```bash
cd ~/spacewalks
ls -la
total 288

### Assess the software project (10 min)

Individually inspect the code and data.
Try and see if you can understand what the code is doing and how it is organised.

In the shared document, write down anything that you think is not "quite right", not clear, is missing, or could be done better.

::: hint

Below are some suggested questions to help you assess the code.
These are not the only criteria on which you could evaluate the code and you may find other aspects to comment on.

- If these files were emailed to you, or sent on a chat platform, or handed to you on a memory stick, how easy would it be to find them again in 6 months, or 3 years?
- Can you understand the code? Does it make sense to you?
- Could you run the code on your platform/operating system (is there documentation that covers installation instructions)? What programs or libraries do you need to install to make it work (and which versions)? Are these commonly used tools in your field?
- Are you allowed to reuse this code in your own work? If you did, would the owner expect credit in some form (paper authorship, citation or acknowledgement)? Are you allowed to modify the files or share them with others?
- Is the code written in a way that allows you to easily modify or extend it? How easy would it be to change its parameters to calculate a different statistic, or run the analysis on a different input file?

::: solution

### Solution

What the code does:

- reads data in JSON format line by line and manually parses data from each line
- appends the parsed data to a list
- exports the list with data to a CSV file
- reads all spacewalks durations and adds a cumulative sum for all spacewalk durations up to that point in time
- plots the cumulative durations on a graph where x-axes are dates of spacewalks, and y-axis is the cumulative time spent in space up till then

This is a (non-exhaustive) list of things that could be fixed/improved with our code and data:

#### File and variable naming

- data (`data.json`) and Python script (`my code v2.py`) files could have more descriptive names
- Python script (`my code v2.py`) should not contain blank spaces as it may cause problems when running the code from command line
- variables (e.g. `w`, `t`, `tt`, `ttt`) should have more descriptive and meaningful names
- version control is embedded in the file name (`my code v2.py`) - there are better ways of keeping track of changes to code and its different versions
- the project contains a hidden file `.DS_Store` which is local and personal config file that should not be shared and does not even make sense other than on macOS

#### Code organisation and style

- import statements should be grouped at the top
- commenting and uncommenting code should not be used to direct the flow of execution / type of analysis being done
- the code lacks comments, documentation and explanations
- code structure could be improved to be more modular and not one monolithic piece of code - e.g. use functions for reusable units of functionality
- unused variables (e.g. `fieldnames` meant to be used when saving data to CSV file) are polluting the code and confusing the person reading the code
- spaces should not be used in column names as it can lead to error when reading the data in

#### Code content and correctness

- fixing the loop to 375 data entries is not reusable on other data files and would likely break if the data file changed
- reading the JSON file line by line and extracting the data portions from each line (by removing ",", "[", "]" characters that form part of JSON syntax) is fragile and will break if JSON file is to be reformatted
- running the code twice causes the program to fail as the result file from the previous run will exist (which the code does not check for) and the script will refuse to overwrite it
- the code does not specify the encoding when reading the data in, and we are also not sure what encoding the data was saved in originally
- how can we be confident the data analysis and plot that is produced as a result are correct?

#### Documentation

- there is no README documentation to orient the user
- there is no licence information to say how the code can be reused (which then means it cannot be reused at all)
- it is not clear what software dependencies the code has
- there are no installation instructions or instructions on how to run the code

:::

::::::

As you have seen from the previous exercise - there are quite a few things that can be improved with this code.
We will try to make this research software project a "bit better" for future use.

### Running the code

Let's try to run the code and see if we can reproduce the results.

Open the terminal in VS Code (unless you have already done it) and type the following command.

```bash
$ python3 my\ code\ v2.py
```

You will get an error that looks something like the following:

```output
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/USERNAME/Downloads/spacewalks/my code v2.py", line 2, in <module>
    data_f = open('/home/sarah/Projects/astronaut-analysis/data.json', 'r')
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/home/sarah/Projects/astronaut-analysis/data.json'
```

We get this error because the paths to the data files have been hard coded as absolute paths for the original developer's machine.
Hard-coding paths is not very reproducible, as it means the paths need to be changed whenever the code is run on a new computer.
We will soon fix the code to use the relative paths within the project structure and eventually we will change the code to take in arguments from the command line when it is run too.

So, we cannot even run the code on our machines.
There is also a number of issues we identified with the software project that could do with improving.
For the rest of this course, we will work on fixing these issues and applying some good software engineering practices.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints
* Reproducible research is a practice that ensures that researchers can repeat the same analysis multiple times with the same results.
* Reproducible research practices support rigor, trustworthiness, openness and transparency in scientific research; increase the quality, efficiency and speed of research; facilitate reuse and citation of all research outputs and career development of people who produce them.
* In the context of the software we write to support our research, reproducible practices mean others being able to obtain and install our software, run our code and obtain the same results we did.
* This can mean a number of things, but a good place to start is sharing your software openely and collaborating with others; using version control to know who changed what and when; setting up reproducible software development environments that can be replicated across different machines, systems and platforms; testing your software to ensure it produces correct results; documenting your software so others can understand and reuse it; following coding conventions and writing modular code so others can more easlity read, understand and reuse it.
